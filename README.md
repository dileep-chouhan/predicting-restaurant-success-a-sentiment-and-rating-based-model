# Predicting Restaurant Success: A Sentiment and Rating-Based Model

## Overview

This project analyzes restaurant reviews and ratings to build a predictive model for restaurant success.  The analysis combines sentiment analysis of textual reviews with numerical rating data to identify key factors influencing restaurant performance and to predict future success. The model aims to provide insights into what aspects of a restaurant contribute most to positive customer experiences and ultimately, profitability.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that the necessary data files (specified within the `main.py` script) are present in the project directory.


## Example Output

The script will produce output to the console, summarizing key findings from the analysis, including:

* Statistical summaries of rating distributions.
* Sentiment analysis results (e.g., average sentiment scores for different aspects of the restaurant).
* Model performance metrics (if a predictive model is included).

Additionally, the script will generate several plot files (e.g., `sentiment_distribution.png`, `rating_vs_sentiment.png`) visualizing the data and model results. These files will be saved in the project directory.  The exact output and plots will depend on the data used and the specific analysis performed by the model.
